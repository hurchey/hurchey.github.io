											<li>
												Although it seems very easy to do, it was actually quite a challenge to ensure that 
												the other parts of this print will all in check such as the 3D printer working properly, 
												the file that was downloaded into the 3D printer, and understanding how to use PrusaSlicer.
											</li>
											<li>
												I am missing some photos of my previous attempts at making my name tag, but this came out 
												to be my final product that very much like and happy about.
											</li>
											<li>
												To create as such, I first went into the PrusaSlicer software on my laptop so that I 
												first edit the 3D render of my nametag to have my name on it. Then I had to download that 
												into a G-Code file that the 3D printer could read. Then I downloaded that G-Code file into 
												a flash drive which was then put into the 3D printer so I could then select the file to be 
												printed. It was about a 15 minute print from start to finish. I used one filament color for 
												the whole name tag.

										<h3>Part 2</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Exact same steps as making the Name Tag print.
											</li>
											<li>
												Despite this looking like nothing failed in terms of printing, this was supposed to be a 
												test to see how 3D printers would react when you do not use the software correctly. My hope 
												for this print was to test the 3D printer on how it would draw the ears of this keychain without any support
												beams so that in theory, the 3D printer would start to draw the ears from the surface of the 3D board rather 
												than where the ears should be. While I was playing around with the PrusaSlicer software and trying to 
												remove all of the support beams on the ears, it seems as if it did not happen so the whole print went through with
												no errors which is considered a failure in this context.
											</li>
											<li>
												This print took a total of 3.5 hours.

										<h3>Part 2</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Exact same steps as making the Name Tag print.
											</li>
											<li>
												This print is supposed to replace the Stitch Keychain print that I did before since I wanted to test to
												see what would happen to the 3D printer if there was something suspended in mid air with no support beams to help it print. 
												I realize that without support beams when trying to print something like a bridge or ears that are in the air, the 3D printer
												will just start to print on the surface of the 3D printing board and think that is where it left off causing the filament to 
												be all over the place and not stable at all and very weak. I realize that support beams are extremely important and needed 
												in almost every kind of build that are similar to the ones that I did for this project.
											</li>
											<li>
												This print took a total of 10 minutes.

										<h2>Car Keychain (Sketch)</h2>
										<p style="margin-top: -15px; margin-bottom: 15px;"><i>(practice remixing 3D files using Tinkercad)</i></p>
										<h3>Part 1</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>
												In my opinion, I actually found this part quite challenging in many ways. I found it quite difficult to not only 
												properly work, but to also think of a good way to make some sort of hook that was strong enough to be a keychain.
											</li>
											<li>
												My steps to creating my first creation was first making a sketch of what the keychain would look like which was 
												a keychain of a Porsche 918 Spyder. Next, I went to Tinkercad to try to bring that imagine to life and what was
												difficult about this was finding the right shapes in Tinkercad to help me in this project. It all seem like the 
												things on the website was all that helpful. Then after I found a design that I thought was good enough for a hook,
												I went to go to PrusaSlicer to try to see if I could bring it life. Now here is the hard part, I soon realized that 
												the whole print was a failure in the sense that the hook part of the keychain did not print properly at all. I am 
												actually still a little confused as to why that is the case but overall, I would have to say that this part of the 
												project was a failure.

										<h2>Cup (Initial Creation)</h2>
										<p style="margin-top: -15px; margin-bottom: 15px;"><i>(practice remixing 3D files using Fusion)</i></p>
										<h3>Part 3</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>
												So based on my last creation, I decided to change up and create something from Fusion which was a cup. It was a 
												bit of learning curve to try to learn Fusion and implement things in Fusion, but once I got the hang of it, 
												I was able to make a cup 3D model. I was using Fusion's lines and different shapes that are already in the software and
												try to make the cup. It was pretty difficult having everything line up as how a cup should be. 
											</li>
											<li>
												This is where my problem happened, the model that I created had a very major flaw in that the bottom of the cup was not 
												even and PrusaSlicer could not read my print to be flat on the printing board which was very weird.
											</li>
											<li>
												Even after many attempts to try to fix my issue and trying to make the cup as smooth and straight as possible, 
												nothing seemed to work. I even tried to print it with support beams to see if that would fix
												or do anything. While I do not have a photo of what happened due to my forgetfulness, the print from the first 
												3 minutes already failed and did not stick to the board. This part of the project also seemed like a failure. 
											</li>
											<li>
												I even went as far as trying to create 3 other 3D models, but they all became harder and seemed more likely to fail than 
												the previous one.
											</li>

										<h3>Part 4</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>
												As a last ditch effort to make something work in Fusion, I decided to go back to my roots and make another keychain,
												but this time, the keychain would have a much clearly hook that is more sturdy and visible.
											</li>
											<li>
												So in Fusion, I made sure that I used a hook that was very much visible not only by me, but also by the printer who has
												to print out my 3D model. 
											</li>
											<li>
												As you can see, the model came out perfect and there are just support beams left. This print looks much better and 
												you can clearly see the hook in the back.
